# Sequence Wallet Linking demo
This demo uses the related Sequence API endpoints to link wallets.

It uses sequence.js embedded wallet (WaaS) package to login to the parent wallet (parent wallet is the one the linked wallet will be linked to), and uses SequenceKit package to connect the wallet that will be linked.
