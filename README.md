# Embedded Wallet Verification + EOA Wallet Link Demo
This repo contains a basic Cloudflare Worker service and a web client application implementation that can be used alongside any Sequence Embedded Wallet integrated game (on web, Unity, Unreal or mobile) to automatically verify an Embedded Wallet. Using this method, integrators can allow the player to link other EOA wallets they own for transferring assets or for verification purposes.
